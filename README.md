# Healthy First

This repository contains the front-end and back-end code of my HealthyFirst application. The front end was build using Angular with VS Code and the back-end was build using Spring Boot with IntelliJ IDEA. In order to respect a minimum security requirements the application should use Spring Security for securing back-end. This application is using PostgreSQL for database.

This application was created based on information from "Forever Strong" by Dr. Gabrielle Lyon and contains:
- A database with the amount of macronutrients of essential foods that are divided into several categories, which can be easily seen thanks to the filters in the application.
- The possibility of creating a personalized food program depending on the proposed objective, if you want to lose, maintain or gain body weight, the number of kilograms and physical activity.
- The application calculates the number of macronutrients and kcal for each meal depending on the information received from the user.
- A sports program, which contains links for each exercise, so that they can be executed correctly, which can be applied both at home and in fitness rooms.
