#Healthy First

This repository contains the front-end and back-end code of my HealthyFirst application. The front end was build using Angular with VS Code and the back-end was build using Spring Boot with IntelliJ IDEA. In order to respect a minimum security requirements the application should use Spring Security for securing back-end. This application is using PostgreSQL for database.
